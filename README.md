# This is the first project that I developed at Ironhack in one week.

It consist in a quiz with 8 questions, where you have 25 seconds to answer each one. 
The faster you answer the more score you make.


Some questions may seem very basic to a lot of people but unfortunately there are still many people who do 
not take pollution as a serious matter that must involve everyone's collaboration.
Therefore the goal of this quiz is to raise awareness in people that still not informed of the actual situation of pollution, 
especially regarding marine and water pollution, with the aim to change their behaviours and recycle more and avoid buying 
packages constituted of plastic.
